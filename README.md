## Overview
Psychic-game is a jQuery powered single-page guessing game. At the beginning of the round, the computer picks a letter as its choice. The user must then guess the letter the computer has chosen via their keyboard. The user has 9 attempts to guess the letter, each wrong guess being shown on the screen. If the user guesses correctly they win the round, if they run out of guesses they lose the round.
## How to use

Upon first viewing the site, user is presented with the single-page in its pre-game state.

When the user inputs their first letter, they will most likely be presented with a wrong guess screen that shows each incorrect guess as well as attempts remaining.

![game tells user to guess again, attempts remaining and incorrect letter guessed](/assets/screenshots/wrong.jpg)

If the user guesses correctly, they are presented with the win screen and invited to guess again.
